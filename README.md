Hello, <br> <br> My name is Harry. <br> <br>
I have been developing software for 3 years. In this time I have built, fixed and maintained websites for local business clients.  <br>
During my experience as a developer working both contract and permanently. I have recently made contributions to an A.I. project recently over here on GitHub. <br> My primary knowledge is with REACT.JS, HTML, CSS, C#, Python, Git etc. However, I have also briefly worked with MySQL databases and have had exposure towards how APIs and servers are used/maintained from my mentor.
- ðŸ“« I am currently open to work, if my story interests and aligns with you, please get in touch at: harrylong96@yahoo.com . <br>
Kind Regards, <br>
Harry Long
